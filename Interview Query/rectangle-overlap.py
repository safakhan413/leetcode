# You are given two rectangles a and b each defined by four ordered pairs denoting their corners on the x, y plane. Write a function rectangle_overlap to determine whether or not they overlap. Return True if so, and False otherwise.

# Note: If the two rectangles border one another, or share a corner like two diagonally adjacent positions on a chessboard, they are said to overlap.

# Note: The lists of ordered pairs are in no particular order. The first entry in list a could be the top left corner while the first in list b is the bottom right.

# Example:

# Input:


# a = [(-3,5), (-3,2),(0,5),(0,2)]
# b = [(-1,4), (3,4), (3,1), (-1,1)]

def rectangle_overlap(a, b):
    '''Algo
