def threeSumClosest(nums, target):
    '''
    Algo:
    - inputs are nums and target. Find 3 ints in nums 
    - output:the sum that is closest to target
    Steps:
        1st attempt:
        step1: make a set of 3 from list. Use combinations from itertools
        use a for loop to sum each combination and 


    '''
    comb = combinations(nums,3)
    for i in 
nums = [-1,2,1,-4],
target = 1
